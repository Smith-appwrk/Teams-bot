# Azure App Service Deployment Guide - Chart.js Solution

This guide explains the simplified deployment approach using only Chart.js for chart generation.

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that Azure App Service doesn't have Chrome installed by default, causing Puppeteer to fail. We've completely removed Puppeteer dependency and now use a reliable Chart.js-only solution.

## New Approach

### ✅ What We Use Now:

- **Vega**: Server-side chart rendering using Vega and Vega-Lite
- **No Browser Dependencies**: No Chrome, Puppeteer, or browser requirements
- **Azure App Service Compatible**: Works out-of-the-box on Azure App Service
- **High-Quality Charts**: Professional-looking charts with enhanced styling

### ❌ What We Removed:

- Puppeteer dependency
- Chrome installation requirements
- Complex browser launch configurations
- Plotly HTML rendering
- All browser-related environment variables

## Features

### Supported Chart Types:

1. **Bar Charts** - Enhanced with rounded corners and hover effects
2. **Line Charts** - Smooth curves with gradient fills
3. **Pie Charts** - With percentage labels and professional styling
4. **Doughnut Charts** - Modern donut-style pie charts

### Enhanced Styling:

- Professional color palettes
- Responsive design
- Custom fonts and typography
- Hover animations
- Percentage calculations for pie charts
- Unit support for all chart types

## Deployment

### Simple Deployment Steps:

1. **Deploy your code** to Azure App Service
2. **That's it!** No additional configuration needed

### No Environment Variables Required:

- No Puppeteer configuration
- No Chrome paths
- No browser-related settings
- Standard Node.js deployment

## Benefits

### ✅ Reliability:

- No browser dependencies to fail
- Consistent rendering across environments
- Fast chart generation
- Lower memory usage

### ✅ Maintenance:

- Simpler codebase
- Fewer dependencies
- No browser version conflicts
- Easier debugging

### ✅ Performance:

- Faster chart generation
- Lower resource usage
- No browser startup time
- Smaller deployment size

## Chart Quality

The new Chart.js implementation provides:

- **High-resolution output** (1200x700 pixels)
- **Professional styling** with modern color schemes
- **Interactive tooltips** (when viewed in browser)
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Accessibility features** built into Chart.js

## Migration Notes

If you were previously using the Puppeteer version:

1. **No code changes needed** in your bot logic
2. **Same API interface** - `generateGraph(data, type, title)`
3. **Same output format** - PNG images
4. **Improved reliability** and faster generation

## Troubleshooting

### If charts don't generate:

1. Check the application logs for Canvas-related errors
2. Ensure the temp directory is writable
3. Verify Chart.js dependencies are installed

### Canvas Issues:

If you encounter Canvas compilation issues on Azure:

- This is rare but can happen with certain Node.js versions
- Try using Node.js 18.x (recommended for Azure App Service)
- Canvas is a native dependency that usually works well on Azure

## Performance Monitoring

Monitor your application for:

- Chart generation time (should be <1 second)
- Memory usage (significantly lower than Puppeteer)
- File cleanup (old charts are automatically cleaned up)

The new approach is much more reliable and suitable for production Azure App Service deployments.
